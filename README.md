# Apple Pay 

## Overview and Origin

* Apple Inc. is a company that needs no introduction. It has always been known for doing things differently and going into Apple Pay did disrupt the Credit Card Industry in a big way.

* Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 and was originally incorporated at Cupertino CA in January 1977.

* The service was in preparation for "a long time", as Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments. Apple partnered with American Express, MasterCard and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013, though they had discussed Apple's potential involvement for years. Their joint solution was a system where single-use digital tokens would replace the transfer of personal information. A Visa executive said that 750 people at the company worked on the anonymized "token" system for a year, and the other partners had similar teams in collaboration. MasterCard began work on the project in 2013 and hoped that their joint work would become a "standard for mobile payments". The announcement of the service came at a time when MasterCard and Visa policy created strong incentives for upgrading to mobile payment-compatible point of sale systems. Apple then approached several big banks in mid-2013 and did not divulge the names of the other banks. To maintain secrecy, JPMorgan set up a windowless "war room" where the majority of the sensitive work was done. Of their 300 people on the project, about 100 knew that the partner was Apple. Others close to the project did not know it was named "Apple Pay" until the announcement. The company's participation remained a secret leading up to its announcement. The service was announced at Apple's iPhone 6 event on September 9, 2014. At its announcement, Apple CEO Tim Cook described the magnetic stripe card payment process as broken for its reliance on plastic cards' "outdated and vulnerable magnetic interface", "exposed numbers", and insecure "security codes".

## Business Activities:

* When we talk about mobile payments, we usually refer to the core feature of what’s quickly becoming known as the digital wallet. Like a physical wallet, not everything inside it is intended as a payment output. Most people carry licenses, gift and loyalty cards, photos, receipts, and even cash, all of which is being increasingly digitized and indexed by various startups.

* Apple Pay has several advangates. One of the major advantages is the user base. On just iPhones alone in 2018 they had more than 101 million users based on the information from Statistica Citation. Thieft prevention is imbedded on the iphone devices with its hardware security with the finger print detection and face recognition. The information embedded to pay is automatically uploaded to point of sale without giving your credit card information to the merchant. This works because when you set up the Apple wallet it encripts your credit card information and sends it Apple. What comes back when tapping your phone is an encrypted device account number which is a unique id to your device and card which is isolated by a digital moat. Reference 2. It is easy to use since normally everyone carries their phone and now their are 4.5 million terminals to use (See reference 2).

* Apple Pay's disadvantages is limited to using the actual Apple product which is pricy. Refusal from merchants to include Apple Pay to accept the payment method. iCloud's reputation as of late which has been famiously known for celebrity private photos/videos. Locating which merchants use Apple Pay.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

* Apple Pay uses the EMV Payment Tokenisation Specification. The service keeps customer payment information private from the retailer by replacing the customer's credit or debit card Funding Primary Account Number (FPAN) with a tokenized Device Primary Account Number (DPAN), and creates a "dynamic security code generated for each transaction". The 'dynamic security code' is the cryptogram in an EMV-mode transaction, and the Dynamic Card Verification Value (dCVV) in a magnetic stripe data emulation-mode transaction. 

* To pay at points of sale, users hold their authenticated Apple device to the point of sale system's NFC card reader. iPhone users authenticate by using Touch ID, Face ID, or passcode, whereas Apple Watch users authenticate by double-clicking a button on the device. To pay in supported iOS apps, users choose Apple Pay as their payment method and authenticate with Touch ID or Face ID.[6] Users can add payment cards to the service in any of four ways: through the payment card listed on their iTunes accounts, by taking a photo of the card, being provisioned from within the card issuer's app, or by entering the card information manually.

* About two-thirds of merchants accept Apple Pay, but many terminals don't. Due to provisioning differences between countries (and even between issuers), users may encounter acceptance issues when travelling to a different country. Some known issues include:

* Canada, UK, Saudi Arabia, and possibly other non-US-issued VISA cards only support EMV-mode transactions and not legacy magnetic stripe data emulation transactions. Some contactless terminals in the US do not support EMV-mode contactless transactions (even if they support EMV contact transactions), and therefore these visitors to the US will receive a 'Could Not Complete Payment' error on the iPhone screen and an error on the terminal when attempting to use Apple Pay.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Apple pay biggest competitior is Samasung but in no way or form we are saying there is no other competition. The competitor list is long and non ending starting from all the big bank like Citi, JPMC, BOA and Wells, it goes side by side with Paypal, Amazon, Zelle etc.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* While Apple Pay benefits from Apple's unique, and quite frankly somewhat monopolistic position in the mobile phone market, Apple Pay has somewhat struggled in uptake due to other services that have a greater foothold in electronic payments. Apple Pay would have to utilize greater leverage of its favorable and monopolistic positioning in order to increase uptake of the product. In short, the best path for them might be to utilize more anti-competitive behaviors in direct retail payment settings in order to increase usage in other areas, such as direct payments between individuals. This may be the only path for Apple Pay to gain market share. This would follow a somewhat 'I-tunes - forced usage/captive audience model.
